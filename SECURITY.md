## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Keikaku, please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue.

Instead, please send an encrypted email to the maintainers at **[security@rothackers.com]**.

### What to Include

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Proof of Concept (PoC) code or steps to reproduce.
- Impact assessment.
- Any potential mitigation strategies.

### Response Timeline

We commit to acknowledging receipt of your report within 48 hours and providing a status update within one week. We follow responsible disclosure practices and ask that you refrain from public disclosure until a fix is released.

### Bug Bounty

Currently, this is a volunteer-led open source project and we do not offer monetary rewards for vulnerability reports. However, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution in our release notes and Hall of Fame (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep Keikaku secure!
